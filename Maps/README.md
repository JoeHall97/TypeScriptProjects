# Google Maps App

A web app that uses google maps to place randomly generate users and companies, onto a map.

To run the app, first you'll need to provide a google maps api key, placing it in index.html.
You'll then need to install parcel bundler, which can be done using the following command:
`npm i -g parcel-bundler`
then run:
`parcel index.html`
